    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
            Potential clients should be made aware of all common threats and vulnerabilities. When all development team members are included in the conversation about the site's security concerns, it helps ensure that all security issues are handled properly. Security of the website should be considered from the beginning of the development process, not implemented later on.

            All of the website's users should be required to use strong passwords and ideally two-factor identification, such as an authentication code sent via sms. Using a secure and trusted outside application can be helpful, as long as research is done to confirm its legitimacy. Unnecessary data should not be stored or displayed, especially sensitive information such as credit card numbers or personal details. Only display a minimal amount necessary for the user to confirm the information is correct, for instance, the last 4 digits of a credit card number. The user's credentials should also be set to timeout automatically. 

            Vulnerability scanning tools can assess your site for weaknesses and help you make the correct changes to avoid them. Automating security checks with CI/CD tools such as “Jenkins” or “Circle CI” can help prevent any oversights from the development team. Third-party options are also available to help in the sanitization of data. 
             
            Web security risks will always continue to evolve. Regularly checking resources like OWASP will help your team to recommend appropriate security measures to clients.</p>
